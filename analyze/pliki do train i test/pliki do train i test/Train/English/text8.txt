Quartering is a method of joining several different coats of arms together in one shield by dividing the shield into equal parts and placing different coats of arms in each division.[1]
Simple quartering, crudely drawn. De Salis quartered with Fane.
The flag of Maryland has a quartering of the coats of arms of the Calvert and Crossland familie
Typically, a quartering consists of a division into four equal parts, two above and two below (party per cross). Occasionally the division is instead along both diagonals (party per saltire) again creating four parts but now at top, bottom, left, and right.
An example of party per cross is the coat of arms of the United Kingdom, as used outside Scotland, which consists of four quarters, displaying the Arms of England, Scotland and Ireland, with the coat for England repeated at the end. (In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish coat appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.). An example of party per saltire is the arms of the medieval Kingdom of Sicily which also consists of four sections, with top and bottom displaying the coat of the Crown of Aragon, and left and right the coat of the Sicily branch of the Hohenstaufen dynasty during their reign as Holy Roman Emperors.
In most traditions, there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed. For example, the records of the College of Arms include a shield of 323 quarterings for the family of Lloyd of Stockton. These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated attributed arms assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier.[2]
Another example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in Scottish heraldry, and may well apply in other jurisdictions like Canada and South Africa.
The arms of the King of the United Kingdom are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of his kingdom. However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent: in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.
