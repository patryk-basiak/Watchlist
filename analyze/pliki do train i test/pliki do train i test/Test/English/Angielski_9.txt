In early depictions, as with dragons in other cultures, the distinction between Germanic dragons and regular snakes is blurred, with both being referred to as: "worm" (Old English: wyrm, Old Norse: ormʀ, ormr, Old High German: wurm), "snake" (Old English: snaca, Old Norse: snókr, snákr, Old High German: *snako), "adder" (Old English: nǣdre, Old Norse: naðr, Old High German: nātara), and more, in writing; all being old Germanic synonyms for serpent and thereof (compare the English names for the common legless lizard: blindworm, hazelworm, slowworm, deaf adder etc). The descendent term worm remains used in modern English to refer to dragons, such as those similar to snakes or without wings,[1] while the Old English form wyrm has been borrowed back into modern English to mean "dragon".[2] The Nordic descendants of Old Norse: ormr – Danish: orm, Faroese: ormur, Icelandic: ormur, Norwegian: orm, Swedish: orm – beyond being the common word for snake in Faroese, Norwegian and Swedish, in Danish and Icelandic more ambiguous with invertebrate worms, remain a poetic or archaic word for dragon and similar mythological serpentine creatures.[3][4][5][a] A similar theme can be seen in German, with surviving compositions such as Lindwurm and Tatzelwurm etc.


An early appearance of the Old English word dracan (oblique singular of draca, "dragon") in Beowulf[6]
The word "dragon", contemporaneously also appear: Old English: draca, Old West Norse: dreki, Old East Norse: draki, Old High German: trahho, tracho, tracko, trakko, meaning "dragon, sea serpent or sea monster" etc, stemming from Latin: dracō, meaning "big serpent or dragon", itself from Ancient Greek: δράκων (drákōn) of the same meaning.[7][8][9] The form "dragon", in modern English, stems from Old French: dragon, while the Germanic Old English form survives as drake.[9][8]

A poem, by 11th-century Icelandic skáld Þjóðólfr Arnórsson, manages to use all four above mentioned terms in a single poem about Sigurd the dragon slayer, based on a fight between a blacksmith and a leather worker, which Arnórsson supposedly composed spontaneously upon request:[10]
