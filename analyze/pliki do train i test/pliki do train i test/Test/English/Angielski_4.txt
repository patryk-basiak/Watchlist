The English Reformation took place in 16th-century England when King Henry VIII wished to divorce his Spanish wife, Catherine of Aragon (who had delivered no viable sons), and marry Anne Boleyn, at the time a lady-in-waiting. The English Church then broke away first from the authority of the pope and bishops over the King and then from some doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church. It then became the Church of England rather than a regional division of the Catholic Church.

The English Reformation began as more of a political affair than a theological dispute.[note 1] In 1527 Henry requested an annulment of his marriage, but Pope Clement VII refused. In response, the Reformation Parliament (1529–1536) passed laws abolishing papal authority in England and declared Henry to be Supreme Head of the Church of England. Final authority in doctrinal disputes now rested with the monarch. Though a religious traditionalist himself, Henry relied on Protestants to support and implement his religious agenda.

The theology and liturgy of the Church of England became markedly Protestant during the reign of Henry's son Edward VI (1547–1553) largely along lines laid down by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. During the reign of Henry’s daughter Mary I (1553–1558), Catholicism was briefly restored. The Elizabethan Religious Settlement reintroduced the Protestant religion but in a more moderate manner. Nevertheless, disputes over the structure, theology, and worship of the Church of England continued for generations.

The English Reformation is generally considered to have concluded during the reign of Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I (1558–1603), but scholars also speak of a "Long Reformation" stretching into the 17th and 18th centuries. It affected in turn other nations and territories reigned over by the Tudors: such as Wales and the Pale in Ireland.

A substantial but dwindling minority of people from the late 16th to early 19th centuries remained Catholics in England – their church organisation remained illegal until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.
